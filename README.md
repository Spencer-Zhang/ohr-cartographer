ohr-cartographer
================
Reads OHR RPG formats and saves tilemaps as PNGs. For now, this program will only print out the first map in a game.

###Usage
```
ruby main.rb <rpg-name> <map_number>    # Draws one specific map from the game
ruby main.rb <rpg-name> all             # Draws all the maps in the game (this can take a while!)
```
